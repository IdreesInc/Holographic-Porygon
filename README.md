# Holographic Porygon

## What is it?

It's a Porygon displayed as a hologram through the [Looking Glass Portrait](https://lookingglassfactory.com/portrait)!

[Click here to check it out](https://idreesinc.github.io/Holographic-Porygon/dist/), but note that it requires specialized hardware to be viewed as a "hologram"!

## How do I use it?

Well for starters you'll need a [Looking Glass display](https://lookingglassfactory.com/) of some kind and a computer capable of rendering multiple views in real time. Connect your computer to the display through the USB-C and HDMI cables and then open up the [webpage](https://idreesinc.github.io/Holographic-Porygon/dist/) and drag it over. I've written some code to automatically switch renderers when the page is loaded depending on whether the Looking Glass is connected or not, but if you opened the webpage prior to connecting the display then you'll need to refresh.
